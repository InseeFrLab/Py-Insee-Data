# Direct download from insee.fr


**TO BE COMPLETED**

The sources available in this package are all listed
[here](https://inseefrlab.github.io/DoReMIFaSol/reference/liste_donnees.html)

The following packages are necessary to execute the following examples:

```{python}
#| lines_to_next_cell: 0
import pynsee.download
import pandas as pd
```


## Find years available for a data source

Let's assume we are interested in French census data (codename: `RP_LOGEMENT`). 

All datasets matching a given codename can be retrieved using `millesimesDisponibles`.
They are returned as a dict type and are easily converted into a standard pandas table:

```{python}
pd.DataFrame(pynsee.download.millesimesDisponibles("RP_LOGEMENT"))
```

## Request dataset from insee.fr website

The easiest approach is to use `telechargerDonnees`
